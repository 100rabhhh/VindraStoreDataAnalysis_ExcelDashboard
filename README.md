# VindraStoreDataAnalysis_ExcelDashboard
In this project, I developed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze sales data for Vrinda Store in 2022. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of sales data, helping to identify trends and areas for improvement in sales strategies.

Key Features and Insights:
Overall Metrics:

Total Sales and Orders: Visualized together to show their relationship.
Top Sales Month: Determined the month with the highest sales and orders.
Customer Demographics: Women accounted for approximately 65% of total purchases.
Order Status: Analyzed different order statuses throughout the year.
Top Contributing States: Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh were the top three states contributing to sales.
Age and Gender Relationship: Examined how age and gender affected the number of orders.
Sales Channels: Identified Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra as the top sales channels.
Highest Selling Category: Determined the product category with the highest sales.

Steps Taken:
1.	Data Preparation:
Cleaned and structured sales data, ensuring accurate and relevant information.

2.	Data Import and Transformation:
Imported data into Excel and created pivot tables for necessary metrics.

3.	Visualizations:
Created various charts (bar charts, pie charts) to represent key insights such as sales by gender, age, department, and education field.

4.	Interactive Elements:
Incorporated slicers and interactive elements for users to explore the data in-depth.

This project showcases my ability to create meaningful visualizations, handle sales data effectively, and provide actionable insights using Excel.
